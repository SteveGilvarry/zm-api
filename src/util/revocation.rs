//! In-memory token revocation registry.
//!
//! JWTs are stateless, so logout / password change / user disable need a
//! server-side floor on token issue time to have any effect. ZoneMinder
//! models this as `Users.TokenMinExpiry`: tokens issued before that instant
//! are dead. This registry is the hot-path copy of that column — consulted by
//! [`crate::util::authz::enforce`] on every protected request without a
//! database round-trip.
//!
//! Durability contract:
//! - Revocations are written to `Users.TokenMinExpiry` *and* recorded here.
//! - The registry is hydrated from the DB at startup ([`AppState::new`]), so
//!   revocations survive restarts.
//! - Refresh tokens are additionally checked against the DB row inside
//!   [`crate::service::auth::refresh_token`], which loads the user anyway.
//!
//! [`AppState::new`]: crate::server::state::AppState::new
