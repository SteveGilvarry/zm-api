// Use jemalloc as the process-wide allocator. This crate is a long-running,
// allocation-bursty media server (HLS segmenting, WebRTC, ffmpeg decode/mux
// buffers): under glibc malloc, freed buffers are retained in per-arena free
// lists rather than returned to the OS, so RSS sits at its high-water mark for
// the life of the process. jemalloc returns freed pages aggressively, keeping
// RSS close to the live working set. Defined here in the library so every
// binary that links it (the `zm_api` server and `fixture-doctor`) and the test
// harness all pick it up. Gated off MSVC, where jemalloc is unavailable.
// Guarded by tests/jemalloc.rs.
