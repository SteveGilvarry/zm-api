//! A browser page load must not be rate-limited (GH #70).
//!
//! zm-web could not render a single screen: every request in a page load came
//! back 429. The cause was a burst of 0 being clamped silently to 1, so one
//! request succeeded and everything after it was refused — with a setting whose
//! name (`rate_limit_per_second`) read as a rate while meaning a period, so
//! `4` gave one request every four seconds rather than four a second.
//!
//! Drives the real router, so it tests the layer as wired rather than the
//! config in isolation.
