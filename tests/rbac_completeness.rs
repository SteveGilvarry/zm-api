//! Every route must be behind an authorization gate (GH #56).
//!
//! The per-feature matrix in `rbac.rs` proves the mechanism works on the routes
//! it names. This proves there are no routes it *doesn't* name: it walks the
//! served OpenAPI document — the same one the router builds — and asserts that
//! a token carrying no permissions at all is refused everywhere.
//!
//! That catches the failure the matrix cannot: someone adds a router to
//! `routes/mod.rs` and forgets to wrap it in `protect`, or wires it to the
//! wrong `Feature`. Today that ships silently.
//!
//! Routes that are deliberately reachable without a feature grant are listed in
//! `UNGATED` below, which doubles as the documentation of that decision. Adding
//! to that list should take a reviewer noticing.
