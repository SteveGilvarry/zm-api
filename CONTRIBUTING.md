# Contributing to zm_api

Thanks for your interest in improving zm_api! This guide covers how to get a change
merged.

## 📜 Contributor License Agreement

zm_api is **dual-licensed** — open source under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE), and available under a
separate commercial license. For the project to be offered under both, every contribution
must be covered by the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md).

**By opening a pull request you agree to the [CLA](CLA.md)** for that and all future
contributions. You keep the copyright in your work — the CLA is a license grant, not an
assignment, that lets the maintainer license the project under both AGPL and commercial
terms. Please read it before contributing.

## 🛠️ Development workflow

zm_api works tests-first. Before opening a PR:

1. **Add or update a test** that captures the behaviour change — it should fail for the
   right reason first.
2. **Implement** the smallest change that makes it pass.
3. **Run the quality gates** — all three must be green:

   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
   cargo test --all-features
   ```

4. If you touched DB-facing code, run the integration suite too (needs the test database):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/db-manager.sh start && ./scripts/db-manager.sh mysql
   APP_PROFILE=test-db cargo test --test '*' -- --include-ignored
   ```

CI enforces the same gates plus a line-coverage floor — keep coverage from regressing by
adding tests alongside new code.

## 🧭 Conventions

- Keep changes small and focused; don't reformat or "clean up" unrelated code.
- Treat `src/entity/` and the SeaORM active enums as **generated artifacts** — regenerate
  them with `./scripts/db-manager.sh generate` rather than hand-editing.
- Map domain failures to `AppError` variants in `src/error/`.
- Don't commit secrets; local config profiles like `settings/dev.toml` are gitignored.
- See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the full repo map, commands, and architecture notes.

## 🐛 Reporting issues

Open a GitHub issue with steps to reproduce, the expected vs actual behaviour, and
relevant logs or config (with secrets redacted).
